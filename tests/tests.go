// Package tests empty
/*Why empty?
The only reason I don't make unit tests is because I think the whole story here is wrong. I believe in the real micro example-usage-tests,
but if you have different opinion make PRs here
*/
/*Alternative:
If you want to test your API use this, new, library ,which after my suggestion has fasthttp & Iris support: https://github.com/gavv/httpexpect
